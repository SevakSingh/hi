## Welcome to the josephus problem solution

A group of people are surrounded by the roman army. These people do not want to be captured so they sit in a circle and kill each other. For example, there are 4 people in a circle and person #1 kill #2 and #3 kills #4. So now there are only 2 people left. Now it is #1 turn and he kills #3. Now number one is the only on left alive. 

Josephus wanted to be captured rather than having to be killed so he decided to choose a place where he would not die. He was in a circle of 41 people. 


## solution in python:
 def josephus(n, k):
    p = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        p += k
        p %= i
    return p + 1
